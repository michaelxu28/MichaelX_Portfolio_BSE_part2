# Hand Wash Timer
 This project is a hand wash timer that counts to twenty seconds every time you wash your hands. It uses a ultrasonic sensor to detect movement 30 cm away to start the timer. The timer is displayed on a OLED display. The project also includes a LCD display which shows the current time and date, and a speaker that plays audio to encourage sufficient hand scrubbing. I will also maybe include a temperature sensor but no promises.

# First Milestone
  
My first milestone was getting the ultrasonic sensor to work and track distance in cm. The ultrasonic sensor sends out a sound wave and calculates the distance it takes for the sound wave to travel and reflect back. Whenever the distance is less than 30 cm, it turns on a led and sends a message to the serial output. This allows me to turn on my 20 second timer every time I wave my hand around the sensor. Instead of putting the timer on the serial, I put it on a LCD display.
